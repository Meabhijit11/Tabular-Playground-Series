# Tabular-Playground-Series

* This is Kaggle's first ever unsupervised clustering challenge!
* In this challenge, they have given a dataset where each row belongs to a particular cluster.
* Our job is to predict the cluster each row belongs to and you are not told how many clusters are found in the ground truth labels.
